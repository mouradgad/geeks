 - the problem explination:
    Given a singly linked list of N nodes.
The task is to find the middle of the linked list. For example, if the linked list is
1-> 2->3->4->5, then the middle node of the list is 3.
If there are two middle nodes(in case, when N is even), print the second middle element.
